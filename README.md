# poll4pop
Poll4pop model (Pollinator 4aging and population dynamic model): R package contains collection of functions for spatially-explicit modelling of central-place foraging pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees etc.).
Uses spatial data in raster format on floral and nesting quality to compute flower visitation and population dynamics for wild pollinators for a given year.
Can be used for multiple years by running a loop and using as input the output of the previous model.
